# Course Description

Open data -- data that is free for use, reuse, and redistribution -- is an
intellectual treasure-trove that has given rise to many unexpected and often
fruitful applications. In this course, students will

1. learn how to **access, visualize, clean, interpret, and share data**, especially open data, using **Python**,
Python-based libraries, and supplementary computational frameworks

1. understand the theoretical underpinnings of open data and their connections to
implementations in the physical and life sciences, government, social sciences,
and journalism.

Working with Open Data (WwOD) is a *technical* course with a strong focus on the social-political context and domains of application of open data.

# Prerequisite

[Info 206 Distributed Computing Applications and Infrastructure](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/i206)  or equivalent background with Python.

#  IPython Notebook Integral to Course

Working through [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
created by the instructor is the primary vehicle for learning at the beginning of the course.

See [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks · ipython/ipython Wiki](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)


# Supplementary Materials

I plan to supplement the book with materials covering the following topics:

* open data, open content in various fields

* using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS together with Python for data presentation,
analysis, and visualization, (e.g., d3.js)

In addition to survey materials on the public domain, creative
commons, and open data movements, I'll focus us on

- Wikipedia, dbpedia, Freebase data
- census data

and other data sets still to be determined, probably large open
scientific data sets

# What we did in 2013

  conflict(s) and to recommend a solution, with the understanding that
  an earlier deadline or date of examination may be the most
  practicable solution.**
  
**It is the student’s responsibility to inform him/herself about material missed because of an absence, whether or not he/she has been formally excused.**

# Stay at home if you are sick

[Campus Flu Guideline](http://teaching.berkeley.edu/sites/teaching.berkeley.edu/files/Academic%20senate%20Flu_0.pdf):

> Students that they should not come to class if they become ill.The
> University has adopted the CDC recommendation that members of the
> campus community who develop flu-like illness should self-isolate
> until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever or signs of
> fever without the use of medication. Let your students know that
> they should follow this recommendation in deciding whether or not to
> come to class

In return: there will be flexibility and good judgment in how course
requirments will be handled.

# Projects

* Participants will work on tangible **projects related to the overall
theme**.

* The projects need to be thorough analyses of some open
dataset or datasets.

* Students can select from a list of projects or they can propose other projects
of comparable scope and intent. 

* Students will have opportunities to brainstorm ideas, choose a specific focal
point (drawing from structured feedback from other students and the instructor),
craft a proposal for their projects, and then present their work at the end of
the course.
  
# Laptops in classroom

I would like everyone to bring a notebook computer to class so that we
can work together in class on programming assignments.  **If you are not able to do so, check in with me.**

# Why Python?

see McKinney's narration: 
<http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592/1dot-preliminaries/id2700570>

# Working definition of open data

From <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Open_data&id=532390265>:

> Open data is the idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone
to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents
or other mechanisms of control.

<http://opendefinition.org/>:

> A piece of content or data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and
redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or
share-alike.

# A Motivating Example: Racial Dot Map

<http://bit.ly/rdotmap>

and

<http://bit.ly/rdotmapintro>

With any luck, we will not only understand how the map works, we'll
also be able to reproduce it and enhance it by the end of the
semester.  That is how to turn **Census 2010** data into a map.

# Activity 1

Group activity -- discuss and enter answers at <http://bit.ly/wwod1401Q>

* What you hope to learn and accomplish in the course?

* Name 2 to 4 types of data (or datasets) that interest or intrigue
  you. Bonus: explain why

* What's one of the more complicated example of Python programming you've done so far?

* What questions do you have for the instructor?

# Activity 2:  Setting up for Programming

We'll study the **population of countries** before we dive into the US Census.

* For homework and in the next class, we'll focus on getting your own
  laptop ready for programming.

* For today, I want you to sign up for the free account on [Wakari.io](https://www.wakari.io/).

* Then, I'll show you how to load up [today's notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_01_A_World_Population.ipynb) into Wakari: <https://raw.github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/master/notebooks/Day_01_A_World_Population.ipynb>

# Homework

## Try to get IPython installed on your computer before class

AJ wrote a nice set of notes on how to do so: <https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/wiki/IPython-Installation-Options>

## Readings

   * read  [Python for Data Analysis Chap 1. Preliminaries : Safari Books Online](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592/1dot-preliminaries/id2664030) The instructions for using
     Enthought Python Distribution are out of date.  If you are
     looking for a distribution, follow  [the installation
     instructions for Anaconda](https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/wiki/IPython-Installation-Options#2-anaconda)  for your computer platform.
   * read `PfDA`, Chap 3 [Python for Data Analysis > 3. IPython: An Interactive Computing and Development Environment](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592/3dot-ipython-an-interactive-computing-and-development-environment/id2545624)
   * skim `PfDA`, Appendix: Python Language Essentials -- to help remind yourself of key elements of standard Python 
   * skim `PfDA`, Chap 2 Introductory Examples

optional video to give you a sense of the huge possibilties of IPython:

# APPENDICES

# Random and not-so random questions for me that open data can help answer

Reading the news, world news, local news, tech news, understanding new contexts,
deepening old interests, controlled serendipity.

* What music to listen to
* What book to read?
* When can I see the next episode of White Collar?
* When was BWV 156 (Ich steh mit einem Fuß im Grabe) first performed?
* How to invest our money?
* What programming language to learn next?
* What charity to give money to?
* What restaurant to try?
* What to cook?
* How should we take care of our physical health?

# Some Big Questions for the Course

* What are the essential characteristics of open data?
* What are the costs and benefits of open data?
* How to map the universe of open data?  What's out there?  What data is not available in open form?
* What can we learn from open data?
* What business models?  
* What are people doing with open data?
* What are the different common formats used to represent open data? (e.g., CSV, XML, KML, SHP in data.gov) -- and how can we use Python to process those formats?
* What are the issues that we face in combining open data with closed data

# data.gov as a good example

<http://www.data.gov/>

<http://www.data.gov/about>:

> The purpose of Data.gov is to increase public access to high value, machine
readable datasets generated by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government."

> A primary goal of Data.gov is to improve access to Federal data and expand
creative use of those data beyond the walls of government by encouraging
innovative ideas (e.g., web applications). Data.gov strives to make government
more transparent and is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness
in Government. The openness derived from Data.gov will strengthen our Nation's
democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.

# Motivation:  why I care about open data and why you might care

Traditional motivations given for open government data:

* transparency
* accountability
* efficiency
* innovation

My personal interests in the area:

* Open data useful testbed for working on data of all sorts, because of zero
  financial costs and minimal restrictions on use, reuse, redistribution

* Growing community around open data because of these low
  barriers...democratization of data...many more of us can participate in
  working with open data and attract a wide range of people I love to learn and
  to think and to understand, a big believer of computational and information
  systems as mind augmenters/extenders and open data (as open digital access in
  general) as an important part of building a powerful personal information
  manager, writ large

Like open source software as an enabler, catalyst, and foundation...you can stand on the shoulder of giants.
