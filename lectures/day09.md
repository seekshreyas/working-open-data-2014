% Day 9:  Creating Projects 
% Raymond Yee 
% February 18, 2014 (<http://is.gd/wwod1409>)

# Goals Today

* Start our thinking about [projects](http://rdhyee.github.io/wwod14/day01.html#(16)).

* Allow students time to continue working on the
  [Day_08_A_Metro_Diversity](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4739621) assignment.

# Projects

* Participants will work on tangible **projects related to the overall
theme**.

* The projects need to be thorough analyses of some open
dataset or datasets.

* Students can select from a list of projects or they can propose other projects
of comparable scope and intent. 

* Students will have opportunities to brainstorm ideas, choose a specific focal
point (drawing from structured feedback from other students and the instructor),
craft a proposal for their projects, and then present their work at the end of
the course.

# Project Proposals

[Due: Friday, March 14, 2014 11:59pm](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4743884).

Write a 1-2 page proposal on how your group (of 2-3 team members) will conduct a thorough analyses of some open dataset or datasets. Use the following template for your proposal:

* Title
* Group members
* Problem Statement
* What open data sets might you be working with?
* Possible ties to Wikipedia (or any Wikimedia related projects)?
* What challenges do you anticipate running into?
* What skills will a team need to develop to solve this problem?

# Some Project Ideas/Topics

I'd gladly help any of you flesh out any of these ideas:

* building a machine readable campus map

* build a campus org chart -- a people finder

* surfacing images and recontextualizing data in
  [Open Context: Data Publication for Cultural Heritage and Field Research](http://opencontext.org/)

* [Free Law Project](http://freelawproject.org/):   reconciling court
  cases to Wikipedia and win at 
  [FantasySCOTUS from the Harlan Institute](http://www.fantasyscotus.net/).

* connect the [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is/) annotation API with
  the IPython notebook to enable annotation of notebooks as well as
  items computed in the notebook.   Throw in [http://futurepress.github.io/epub.js/#getting-started](epub.js) and public domain books.... 

* [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la/): hack ideas from [dp.la Open Committee

* systematically archiving federal government data to archive.org:  I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ekansa/status/397377547362525184): "Does
it make sense to systematically archive US govt data to
@internetarchive? Remember how [http://census.gov](http://census.gov)
gone during \#shutdown" Eric Kansa says [yes and feds should pay for
it](https://twitter.com/ekansa/status/397377547362525184). I have an
idea of having as a class project doing some selective archiving to
archive.org – but would it be conflicting with the business model of
[https://archive-it.org/](https://archive-it.org/)?  It's time try out:
[https://github.com/jjjake/ia-wrapper](https://github.com/jjjake/ia-wrapper).

*
  [OCLC provides downloadable linked data file for the 1 million most widely held works in WorldCat](http://www.oclc.org/en-US/news/releases/2012/201252.html)
  and
  [Harvard Library Bibliographic Dataset | Open Metadata](http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/bibdata)
  (12 million bibliographic records)

* help keep [Amazon Public Data
Sets](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/) up to date. E.g., can we help to
get 2010 census loaded? (to supplement older 2000 data). One thing we
can do as a class is to curate and upload data sets to AWS S3. We'll
typically want to put a lot of our public data in a common place –
Amazon S3 is a great place since we'll likely do a lot of analysis using
AWS.

* rebuild the [Racial Dot Map](http://bit.ly/rdotmap) to enable the
  mapping of arbitrary 2010 Census data variables.

* Working with Wikimedia data of all sorts, using the
  [MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page),
  [Wikipedia:Database download - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download)
  and the
  [Tools Lab](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Nova_Resource:Tools/Help).

* [| CommonCrawl](http://commoncrawl.org/) data -- we have starter
  code from last year to build from.

* [Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine](http://ecoengine.berkeley.edu/): An
  open API serving UC Berkeley's Natural History Data

*
  [New California Water Atlas | Making Water Understandable in California](http://ca.statewater.org/)

* [eLife Lens](http://lens.elifesciences.org/): What can we do with [xml
source](http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/2/e01516.source.xml)?

* [PLOS | Public Library Of Science](http://www.plos.org/) also.

* government org chart: parse [US Government Printing Office - FDsys -
Home](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/#)

*
  [Open Goldberg Variations | Free download of J.S. Bach's masterpiece, played by Kimiko Ishizaka, piano.](http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/)

* real-time BART data:
  [The Real BART API | bart.gov](http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/api)

* real-time AC transit data via nextbus API:  identify the phantom
  buses.


* weather data:  comparing predictions to what actually happened

* Flickr Commons photos:  over a million public domain photos in
  Flickr.

**and many, many more**
