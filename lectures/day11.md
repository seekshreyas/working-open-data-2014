# Goals Today

* quick discuss the Day 8 problem set
* kickstart our work on project proposals
* start to think about the upcoming **midterm**: (Day 17, 2014-03-18)
* prepare for plotting/map discussion on Day 12.


# Answers to Day 8 A Metro Diversity published

As I [announced on bCourses this weekend](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/discussion_topics/3000136), you might benefit from studying a less abstract calculation of
`entropy_rice`, which I present in [Day_11_A_Explicit_Entropy_Calc.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_11_A_Explicit_Entropy_Calc.ipynb)

# Course Github Organization

Fill out [What's your github account
handle?](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4759529) so
that AJ or I can add you to our course github organization: [Working with Open
Data 2014](https://github.com/working-with-open-data-2014). We'll then be able
to create repositories visible to the class only that we can use for your
individual and project work.

# Project Proposals

[Due: Friday, March 14, 2014 11:59pm](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4743884).

Write a 1-2 page proposal on how your group (of 2-3 team members) will conduct a thorough analyses of some open dataset or datasets. Use the following template for your proposal:

* Title
* Group members
* Problem Statement
* What open data sets might you be working with?
* Possible ties to Wikipedia (or any Wikimedia related projects)?
* What challenges do you anticipate running into?
* What skills will a team need to develop to solve this problem?

# Project Brainstorming

To help us brainstorm and refine ideas and to start forming team:  

[Project Ideas and Team Formation for WwOD 2014](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/collaborations/37662),
aka <http://bit.ly/wwod14projgdoc>

Don't forget documents we have on the go:

* [WwoD14 TOC](http://bit.ly/wwod14toc)
* [Some Project ideas](http://bit.ly/wwod14projideas)
* [In-class notes](http://bit.ly/wwod14classnotes) 
* [What do people want to learn (from Day 1)](http://bit.ly/wwod1401Q)
* [Topic: What you hope to learn and accomplish in the course?](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/discussion_topics/2907842)

I need you all to advocate for your own interests, questions, and what you want to learn.

# Upcoming Midterm

* The upcoming **midterm**: (Day 17, 2014-03-18). It will probably consist of
  mostly multiple choice questions.

* Over the next weeks, we'll be using bCourses and quizzes to review fundamentals and to drill concepts.

* Do the simple practice quiz: [Day 11 Practice Quiz: Working with Open Data](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/quizzes/1602074)


# Preparing for Day 12: Plotting/Mapping

* Read Chapter 8 of `PfDA` and make sure you can run [nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_11_B_Setting_Up_for_PfDA.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_11_B_Setting_Up_for_PfDA.ipynb).

You can sign up for a short class co-taught by Dav Clark and Raymond Yee (March
5): [Javascript Visualization |
D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/javascript-visualization). We'll cover
some of the same material in this class, but Dav is a great teacher.

# In Class Activity
