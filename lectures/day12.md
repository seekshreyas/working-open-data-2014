# Goals Today

* Get an overview on plotting options
* Look at Baby Names


# Overview of Plotting Options

Matplotlib (mpl) is fundamental: [matplotlib: python plotting: Matplotlib 1.3.1 documentation](http://matplotlib.org/).  We're going to be using it throughout the course.
I myself am not an expert in mpl -- so we're on a learning curve together.


Assignment for today is to have read Chapter 8 of `PfDA` and make sure you can
run
[nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_11_B_Setting_Up_for_PfDA.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_11_B_Setting_Up_for_PfDA.ipynb).


There's a lot to mpl -- here's what I think are key things to learn:

* There are many backends for running mpl -- we will focus on how to get plots in the IPython Notebook.
* Read the [Matplotlib 1.3.1 documentation](http://matplotlib.org/contents.html), study examples in [mpl gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)
* Note some fundamental conceptual aspects to mpl (as I outline in  [Day_12_A_Matplotlib_Intro.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_12_A_Matplotlib_Intro.ipynb)
and try to make basic plots on your own (line plots, scatter plots, bar plots).

Consider Two libraries that focus on making matplotlib plots prettier by default:

* [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn).  See also [seaborn: aesthetics.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mwaskom/seaborn/blob/master/examples/aesthetics.ipynb)
* [prettyplotlib](https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib)

Other promising libraries:

* [bokeh](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh)
* [vincent](https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent), which ties together Python and [vega](https://github.com/trifacta/vega), which sits on top of
[D3.js - Data-Driven Documents](http://d3js.org/)


# Upcoming workshops at the D-Lab

* Tomorrow: [Getting Things Done with Pandas!](http://python.berkeley.edu/events/2014/02/28/getting-things-done-with-pandas.html)
"Getting Things Done with Pandas" (Feb 28, 2014 4-6pm)

* You can sign up for a short class co-taught by Dav Clark and Raymond Yee (March
5): [Javascript Visualization |
D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/javascript-visualization). We'll cover
some of the same material in this class, but Dav is a great teacher.
